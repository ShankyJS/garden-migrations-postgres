# garden-migrations-postgres

Documenting issue described in [Database Migration tasks/container](https://discordapp.com/channels/817392104711651328/1075450026807021589) post in `help` in Discord.

Basically the issue is that there is not an easy way to run a task automatically, I tried adding the dependencies between services and Garden is still not being able to deploy the task automatically.

I documented two scenarios, each one has their own readme to understand what was the workaround we tried to execute and the issues we faced. Feel free to take a look to both and ask anything to @ShankyJS in Discord!
